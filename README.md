# Meal-Planner

Hyperskill Java Backend Developer project

Every day, people face a lot of difficult choices: for example, what to prepare for breakfast, lunch, and dinner? Are
the necessary ingredients in stock? With the Meal Planner, this can be quick and painless! It is a database of
categorized meals and set the menu for the week. This app will also help create and store shopping lists based on the
meals so that no ingredient is missing.

* `Add` starts the meal input process and prompts users for the meal properties;
* `Show` prints the list of saved meals with their names, categories, and ingredients;
* After executing `add` or `show`, the program should ask what users want to do next;
* The program run until users input `exit` â€” the command that terminates the program.
